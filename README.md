# AccelerometerGraph
This Android app was developed in the context of a masters dissertation, with the objective of creating a navigation and localization system for a museum. The purpose of it is to study human movement, by analysing variations in the sensor output signal.
This is a very simple app, that collects and records measures from the three main smartphone sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer). A separate CSV file for each of the sensors' data is saved onto the Downloads directory.
Note: Uses the FastCSV lib (https://github.com/osiegmar/FastCSV) developed by Oliver Siegmar.
